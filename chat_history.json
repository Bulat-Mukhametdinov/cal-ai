It is a powerful tool for approximating functions and is widely used in calculus and other branches of mathematics.\n\nThe general formula for the Taylor series of a function $f(x)$ around a point $a$ is:\n\n$$f(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n$$\n\nwhere $f^{(n)}(a)$ is the $n$th derivative of $f$ evaluated at $a$.\n\nFor example, the Taylor series of the function $f(x) = e^x$ around $a=0$ is:\n\n$$e^x = 1 + x + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\cdots$$\n\nTaylor series have many applications in mathematics, physics, and engineering, including approximating functions, solving differential equations, and modeling complex systems.",
